# Generative VQ-VAE model on the HipMRI Study on Prostate Cancer using the processed 2D slices
## Problem Overview
The aim of of this problem is to create a generative model of the HipMRI Study on Prostate Cancer using the processed 2D slices using a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE).
